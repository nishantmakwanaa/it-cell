Backpropagation Algorithm (Algo)
This is the core algorithm used in ANNs for computing gradients and updating weights based on the error of predictions. It works by propagating errors backward through the network.

Purpose: Minimize the loss function by adjusting weights to reduce prediction errors.
Focus: Efficiently calculate the gradients of weights to improve the model's performance.
2. Gradient Descent Optimization (Optimization Technique)
This is an optimization technique used to minimize the loss function by updating weights in the direction of the negative gradient. There are different variants of gradient descent, such as:

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD): Updates weights after each training sample.

Mini-Batch Gradient Descent: Updates weights using small subsets of the data.

Adam Optimizer: A popular optimization algorithm that combines momentum and adaptive learning rates for faster convergence.

Purpose: Speed up training and improve convergence.

Focus: Adjust learning rates and gradients dynamically to stabilize and accelerate training.

3. Dropout Regularization (Regularization Technique)
This is a regularization technique designed to prevent overfitting by randomly "dropping out" neurons (disabling them) during training. It ensures that the model doesn't rely too heavily on specific neurons and promotes generalization.

Purpose: Prevent overfitting and improve model robustness.
Focus: Randomly disable a portion of the neurons during training, forcing the network to learn more generalized patterns.
